# Algobop

## Sample Based Song Generator

This is a really rough draft repo, just to get my previous work in sonic pi song generation up on git. 

## Running Algobop

Algobop runs in Sonic Pi. To run it you need to load all the relevant functions, then run a generator / template. 

Algobop also requires samples, you'll need to point it at your sample libraries.

## To Do / Plans / Ideas

- Organize this repo lol
- FX
- Fills, Swells, Drops
- Random "spice" samples
- Add demo sample packs
- More patterns/templates
- Dynamic/generative patterns
- Automate song generation. Make many songs at once.
- Should this run in Sonic Pi? Maybe there's something better for my needs
